# Education-Management-System-TJ
An Education Management System (EMS), focusing on administrative streamlining to enhance educational support

Introduction
This repository hosts the Education Management System project, developed primarily under the IT Business Analyst (BA) role. The project focuses on specifying requirements for an online education platform that supports class management, student handling, teacher assignment, attendance tracking, and related workflows.
Built by the BA team (including myself and colleagues), it provides detailed documentation on:

Workflows and User Flows: User processes for key features like login, class creation/editing, attendance marking, teacher assignment, and makeup class allocation.
Wireframes and Screen Descriptions: Basic UI designs for each module.
Use Cases & Sequence Diagrams: Functional requirements analysis using UML standards.
Access Rights and User Management: Role-based access configuration (Admin, Class Manager, Teacher, Student, Parent, etc.).

Goal: Support the development of educational software (Tech Junior) with emphasis on usability, security, and education-specific workflows.

Key Content
The core of this repo is the comprehensive SRS document, which outlines the system's functional and non-functional requirements based on collaborative BA efforts.

Main SRS File: SRS_Education_Management_v1.docx - Full specification covering:
Login & Authentication: Password-based login and forgot password flows.
Class Management: Create/edit classes, assign teachers, add students, view class details.
